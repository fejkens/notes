# Interface

An interface is a barrier that hides low-level details, allowing for abstraction to happen. In software, an interface is what the user interacts with as they use the program. They havea access to the functionality provided by the developers. An interface also allows the developers to change the under-the-hood details freely as the user only ever sees the interface.

An interface works as a surface for a 'black box'. The user knows what goes into the black box (input) and what comes out of it (output) but they don't have to know how this is achieved.
