# Recursion

Recursion is a problem solving technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller pieces until it can be solved trivially. In programming, recursion involves calling the function or method from within it's definition.

A recursive algorithm must obey three rules:

1. It must have a base case that stops recursion
2. It must move towards the base case
3. It must call itself, recursively.
