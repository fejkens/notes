# Selection sort

The selection sort makes passes through a list, identifying the largest or smaller item. After each pass, the item is swapped with another at the appropriate end. With the next pass, the same process is repeated, this time ignoring the previously swapped element. The elements already swapped to the correct place are ignored.
