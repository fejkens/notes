Data structures explain how we store data in our programs. These can link the data objects in a linear fashion (lists, arrays) or in a tree-like structure (trees). 

Data is typically stored on a computer in files and databases. The actual implementation of these storage types depends on the file system, database we're using, etc. Where data structures come in is when we're using our programs to load this data. For example, given a list of order numbers that is stored in a database, we might choose to load it into a linked list, array, tree or whatever we want.

Different data structures come with advantages and disadvantages. Where a certain data structure might be perfect to solve a certain problem, it might not be a very good choice for a different problem. Understanding these differences is key to developing high quality algorithms.
