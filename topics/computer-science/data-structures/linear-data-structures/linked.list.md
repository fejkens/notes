# Linked list

![Linked list](../pics/linked-list.png)

A linked list is a linear data structure where items are connected. Each piece of data in such a list points to the next until we reach the end of the list. In an implementation of a linked list, each item stores two pieces of data - The actual data we're storing and the pointer to the next item. The pointer is a memory address of the next item. We can use these pointers to move through the list, item by item until we reach the end.
