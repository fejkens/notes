# Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding low-level details when they're not needed. A real-life example is a car: The user of the car knows how to drive it, but they don't have to know how the car actually works under the hood. When there is a problem with the car, a car mechanic can use their knowledge to fix the problem.

The 'barrier' between the user and the mechanic is called an interface. The user is provided with an interface that they can interact with to drive the car, but the actual implementation of these functionalities is hidden as it's not needed to operate the car day to day.
