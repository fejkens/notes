# Programming

Programming is the act of translating algorithms into code. If we can use a computer to solve a problem, we will have to come up with a solution to that problem (algorithm) and translate it into instructions that the computer can understand (code). 

There are many programming languages used in the world, with their advantages and disadvantages. What language is best to use depends on the task and the problem we're trying to solve.
