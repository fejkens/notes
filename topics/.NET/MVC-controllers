### MVC Controllers

### Controller actions

Actions are methods that return Views or JSON data. Any public method of a controller is an action. Action methods have to return IActionMethod.

Action methods can result one of the five major sets of action results:
- Status Code (Returning HTTP status code)
- Status Code with Object result (Returning HTTP status code with a passed in object)
- Redirect result (Redirecting to a different action method)
- File result (Returning a file)
- Content result (Returning a view)
